# 2-ImplementLogging

It can be difficult to see what a non explicitely programmed system does. That's why I'm adding a generic logging solution. Instead of creating a logged solution, I created the [HookedRuntime](../src/main/com/schmueckers/tuple_engine/HookedRuntime.scala)

## Tests
Tests can be found in [TestHookedRuntime](
../src/test/com/schmueckers/tuple_engine/TestHookedRuntime.scala)

## Status
Done
